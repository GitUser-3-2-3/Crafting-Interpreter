# Crafting Interpreter

A hands-on implementation of an interpreter based on Robert Nystrom's
book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). This project aims to build a fully functional interpreter
in multiple stages, progressing from a tree-walk interpreter to a bytecode virtual machine.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in active development. We are focusing on implementing the tree-walk interpreter as the first
milestone, with plans to expand to a virtual machine-based interpreter in future iterations.

## ✨ Features

- Tree-walk interpreter implementation
- Lexical analysis (Scanner)
- Parsing expressions
- Statement execution
- Variable scope management
- Control flow implementation
- Function handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 7 or higher
- Basic understanding of interpreter design concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GitUser-3-2-3/Crafting-Interpreter.git
   cd Crafting-Interpreter
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   Open in Intellij
   ```

3. Run the interpreter:
   ```bash
   run the project
   ```
